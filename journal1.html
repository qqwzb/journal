    I Saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    <blockquote>Passing cars,<br> When you can't see,<br> May get you ,<br> A glimpse,<br> of eternity.<br></blockquote>
    <p>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars.

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Beacause I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole whole lot with me:
..<ol>
    <li>charge segway</li>
    <li>pack for trip
    <ul>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li>ipod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>call mom</li>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</p>
